## Introduction
Two simple Q-Learning implementations for GVG-AI game number 80 In the first implementation, everything the agent is capable of perceiving is used as a state. This method tends to the overfitting of a specific type of problem. In the case of the second implementation, the space of states is reduced to 64 states, allowing the agent not only to learn quickly, but also to overcome all the maps without problems.
